# K-Nearest-Neighbors

 The K Nearest Neighbors algorithim is a nonlinear classifier that defines predictive regions for a select boolean value. You'll often find that the divider between the predictive regions is often not a smooth curve or a straight line, due to KNN not being a linear classifier. However, though simple mode, it can also be very powerful because it's adaptive to nonlinear data. 

 The code in this repo leverages age and estimated salary as two the independent variables for the matrix. The boolean value, purchased or not purchased, is the dependent variable vector.
